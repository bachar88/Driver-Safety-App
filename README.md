# Driver Safety App

An AI-powered solution designed to improve road safety by guiding drivers through safer routes, assisting them in real time using computer vision, and rewarding responsible behavior.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The Driver Safety App enhances driving safety through:

* **AI-based safest route prediction**
* **Real-time road sign detection** using computer vision
* **AI voice assistant** giving contextual driving advice
* **Reward system** that encourages safe driving habits

The application aims to reduce risks, increase driver awareness, and promote safer driving through intelligent assistance and positive reinforcement.

## 🧠 Key Features

### **1. Safe Route Prediction**

Uses machine learning to evaluate multiple possible routes and choose the safest one based on:

* Traffic density
* Road conditions
* Accident history
* Environmental factors

### **2. Computer Vision Driver Assistant**

Detects:

* Road signs
* Speed limits
* Lane markings
* Potential hazards

### **3. Voice Guidance System**

Provides real-time spoken alerts and suggestions to help the driver react safely and correctly.

### **4. Driver Reward System**

Drivers earn points for:

* Respecting signs
* Following AI advice
* Maintaining safe driving patterns

These points can be used for gamification, rankings, or future integrations.
